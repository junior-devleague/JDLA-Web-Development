# MathJax samples

This page demonstrates the use of [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org) for rendering mathematical notation in markdown files.

For example, the following markdoswn:

```
When \\(a \ne 0\\), there are two solutions to \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$
```

when rendered, produces the following text:

When \\(a \ne 0\\), there are two solutions to \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$

You can also create a block of math using the `\\[` delimiter. For example, the following markdown: 

```
\\[ \frac{1}{n^{2}} \\]
```

Produces the following block:

\\[ \frac{1}{n^{2}} \\]
