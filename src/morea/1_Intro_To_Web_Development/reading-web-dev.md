## Welcome to Web Development

In this course, we will learn all about designing and building a website. You will be creating your own web pages from the ground up!

### What is Web Development?

Web Development refers to the building, creating, and maintaining of a website or web application. Web Development also includes many types of web content creation. We will be writing code in a text editor to help us create web page files that make up our website.

### How the WWW Works

Let’s take a step back and talk about how the _World Wide Web_ works.

When two computers are connected to the Internet, they can talk to each other. When you go onto a website, you're being sent an HTML file (more on HTML later) from a _server_ that's hosting the site.

A server is a computer that serves a purpose. And in this case, the purpose is hosting web page files to be sent out to _clients_, which are other computers that connect to the server by typing in the website's URL. A site’s content (all that stuff a website talks about) is organized within a special set of rules that computers understand; sort of like speaking in a secret, coded language, except we will soon be in on this little secret as well!

The web browser (such as Google Chrome) is asking to view a website from the server where the site’s files live. The server is sending the files back and the browser is translating them to display a page on the screen. And this happens very quickly!

It’s all about _communication_ and sharing information.

Because of all this, a site you write locally (on your computer) can’t be seen by other people on a different computer, until you move the files to a server. We’ll will get into that later on.
