# Special Media

In this exercise, you will be creating a web page that hosts 3 different types of media.

## Purpose

The purpose is to find and use the appropriate tags associated with each type of media that you use in a web page.

## Getting Started

1. Create a new project folder called `MediaMadness`.
2. In your new project folder, create an `index.html` file.
3. Open your project folder in Sublime Text.
4. Find 3 different types of media files to use on your web page.

- Some examples of different types of media are:
  - `pdf`
  - `video`
  - `audio`
  - `image`

## Requirements

* Must have a minimum of 3 different types of media on the page.
* Each media example must be labeled with a heading tag stating the media type.
* All code must be indented correctly and contain no syntax errors.
* All files must be from an external web page. e.g. YouTube, Google, etc.

## Instructions

1. Open your `index.html` file.
2. Create the HTML Skeleton.
3. Research the type of media you want in the web page. Google things like: “How to include pdf on a web page?” or “HTML images”.
4. Add an `h1` with the type of media that you are using and the source of the file.
5. Use the tag that you found during your research and add it under the corresponding `h1`. 
6. Refresh the page and then test the tag. Repeat steps 3-5 for each media type.
