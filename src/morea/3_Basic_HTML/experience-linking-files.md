# Linking HTML Documents

In this exercise, you will create 3 HTML files and link them together by making a navigation section at the top of the page.

## Purpose

The purpose of this exercise is to get used to having multiple HTML pages as your website, and linking them together. This exercise also provides experience using attributes in HTML tags.

## Getting Started

1. Create a new project folder
2. Create 3 different HTML files: `index.html`, `about.html`, and `contact.html` inside of that folder
3. Open the project folder in Sublime Text
4. Edit the `index.html` file and get started

## Requirements

* All documents must have a nav element that links all the pages together.
* Each page must have a class `active` on the correct anchor tag.
* When clicking on a link, it must take you to the corresponding HTML file.
* All code must be indented correctly and have no syntax errors.


## Instructions

1. Create the HTML Skeleton in the `index.html` file.
2. Create an `h1` tag that has the name of the web page. e.g. “This is the Home Page”.
3. Above the heading tag, create a nav element that will house all of our links.
4. Create an unordered list with all of the anchor tags that link the web pages together.
5. After finishing the `index.html` page, complete steps 1 through 4 for the remaining HTML files.
