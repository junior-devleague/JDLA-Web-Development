# Special Media and Self-Directed Learning

Wow, this is the last reading in the module!
Congratulations on making it this far! To celebrate, we have a very short reading ahead.

So far, you’ve learned the very basics of HTML. But there’s so much -- relatively simple -- stuff out there that you would really benefit from knowing. That’s where self-directed learning comes in -- you’ll quickly find that one of the most important skills you’ll need to be a developer is the ability to research and learn on your own. 

There will be things you won’t know how to do immediately, because there’s such a vast library of knowledge out there. It’s unlikely you’ll know every single book in the public library system, but as long as you know how to read and look things up, you’ll be able to find the information you’re looking for. 

As HTML gets improved and updated, features get added and deprecated (basically a label we give to features/functions that are no longer recommended or used). HTML5 has several great new features, and it handles images and sounds and other media (PDFs, videos, etc.) in it’s own special way. What you will need to do is look up how to display different media types in your HTML document. 

## What is the W3C?

The W3C is the World Wide Web Consortium, and it’s basically a large group of people who decide and set standards for content of the World Wide Web. They decide what HTML/CSS and other web platforms should be like. 

The W3C has a great resource called [w3schools](http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp), which tells you everything you’d want to know about a tag or property, and even lets you test out your own code. Believe us, you _will_ be using this site a lot for reference/help.

Go on to the [last exercise](link here) of the module! This final exercise will require you to do independent research and utilize outside resources, because this class is about more than just copying code that we give you. Good luck!
