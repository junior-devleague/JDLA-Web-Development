# Personal Profile Page Remake

In this exercise, we will be continuing the [`ProfileProject`](https://junior-devleague.github.io/JDLA-Web-Development/morea/3_Basic_HTML/experience-profile.html) exercise from the HTML module.
You will take the simple website youâ€™ve created and add CSS to give your page some style.

## Purpose

The purpose of this exercise is to take an existing HTML file and link an external CSS sheet as well as give you a first-time experience styling a webpage in a project.

## Sample

<img src="profile-example.png" alt="Styled profile page example">

## Getting Started

1. Create a new project directory called `ProfileRemake`.
2. In your new project directory, add a `css` directory.
3. In the `css` directory, create a `styles.css` file.
4. Locate your `ProfileProject` from the HTML module.
5. Copy the `index.html` file from `ProfileProject` to `ProfileRemake`.

## Instructions

4. Open your `styles.css` file.
5. Target the body and add `color`, `background-color`, and `text-align` properties.
6. Target the image tag and set the `height` and `width` to a desired size.
7. Target the paragraph tag and set the `width` to 3 quarters of the page.
8. Recenter the paragraph tag by setting `margin` to `0 auto`.
