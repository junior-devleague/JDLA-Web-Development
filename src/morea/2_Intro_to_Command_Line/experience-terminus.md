#Terminus

In this exercise, you will play a Role-Playing Game developed by MIT, *Terminus*, to have a fun introduction to using Bash for file navigation and manipulation.

[Click here to play Terminus.](http://mprat.org/Terminus) **Read the rules and instructions at the top (the white text)!**

*Note that everything you learn in Terminus is directly linked to Bash. The spells are commands, locations are directories, and items are files.*

When finished, you’ll be ready for this module’s final reading, “Basic Bash”.
