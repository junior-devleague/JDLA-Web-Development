# Treasure Hunt

For our final exercise, you will use the commands you’ve learned, as well as critical thinking, logic, and mathematical ability (which are all crucial in programming) to traverse a tree of directories in a treasure hunt.

Download the necessary files by typing the following into your terminal:

`cd ~/Downloads`

`git clone https://github.com/junior-devleague/TreasureHunt.git`

### How to play

Begin by `cd`’ing into the “*TreasureHunt*” directory and reading “*rules.txt*”.

Basically, each directory will have a riddle or question you must solve. The sub-directories are your possible answers, so when you solve a problem, `cd` into the answer (which is the name of the directory). Immediately `ls` and read the riddle/question every time you enter a new directory.

**Note: Don’t just guess and randomly `cd`. There are false, misleading paths that will set you back by taking you deeper down to a dead end if you answer incorrectly.**

When you are done with this exercise, show one of your instructors Linus the pirate’s hidden treasure and then move on to the next module, “Basic HTML”.
