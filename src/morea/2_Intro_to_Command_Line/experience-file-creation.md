# File Creation

All of the following must be done exclusively in your terminal with Bash. **Do not use a file manager.**

If you don’t remember the commands you need to use or how to use them, look back on the “Basic Bash” reading or check the manual with the `man` command.

1. In your Desktop, create a directory named after yourself (include first and last name).
2. Within that folder, make two directories for different projects named *`Project1`* and *`Project2`*, and two files named *`named_with_underscores.txt`* and *`thisIsCamelCase.txt`*.
3. In each `Project` directory, create an *`index.html`* file, a *`css`* directory, and an *`images`* directory.
4. Create a *`styles.css`* file in one of the `css` directories, and **copy** it into the other.
5. Use `subl` to edit the `named_with_underscores.txt` file to say “*The statement below is true.*”
6. Use `subl` to edit the `thisIsCamelCase.txt` file to say “*The statement above is false.*”
7. Concatenate both of the above .txt files and print them into the terminal together using one command.
8. Move each of the above .txt files into separate `Project` folders.

When you’ve finished, let one of the instructors know and we will look at your files and history.

Move on to the “Treasure Hunt” assessment to complete this module.
