<h3 id="monday---friday-3pm-to-6pm-saturday-9am-to-4pm">Monday - Friday (3pm to 6pm), Saturday (9am to 4pm)</h3>
<p>The goal of our course is to give students a solid understand of the various aspects of web development. Some of topics we cover are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>HTML / CSS</strong> We cover basic HTML and CSS first, and then later touch on more advanced concepts about page structure and design. HTML and CSS provide the structure and design of a web page, and define what we see on a page.</li>
  <li><strong>UX/UI Design</strong> We go over important concepts of web design such as color theory, display types, media queries, and other principles of good, professional, design.</li>
  <li><strong>JavaScript</strong> The main programming language we will be teaching in this course is JavaScript, which drives modern websites. Students will learn to integrate JavaScript logic and event handling into their websites.</li>
  <li><strong>Git/GitHub</strong> Students will learn to use Git version control and collaborative programming and design. Theyâ€™ll also be pushing their code up to the code-sharing site GitHub, so they can work on their projects from anydevice with an internet connection.</li>
  <li><strong>Open-source software</strong> In this class, students are using free and open source software and tools. All of their code will be pushed up to public repositories on GitHub. We want to foster an appreciation for and have students understand the importance of free and open source software.</li>
  <li><strong>Software engineering</strong>  Students will be working together on projects, and going through design and project management processes similar to those that professional developers go through. They will learn important skills like planning, teamwork, and debugging.</li>
</ul>
