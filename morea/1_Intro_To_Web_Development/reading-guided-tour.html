  <h1 id="how-to-use-this-site">How to use this site</h1>

<p>Welcome to <strong>Web Development</strong>, taught by Jr DevLeague Academy. This class will use our website, which implements a modular (don’t worry if you don’t know what that means) style of learning. This reading is a guided tour of using our site and the modules.</p>

<h2 id="modules">Modules</h2>

<p>The modules are the individual topics that we will cover in this course. Each topic you’ll need to learn will be in its own module. Imagine building furniture – each part comes separately, and then you put it all together to have a functioning desk or chair or something. Each leg of the chair is like each individual module, and when you’ve gone through all the modules, you’ll be able to build a basic, functioning, website.</p>

<p>In turn, each module contains its own learning outcomes, readings, and experiential learning.</p>

<h3 id="learning-outcomes">Learning Outcomes</h3>

<p>The learning outcomes are what we expect you to have learned and understood by the end of the module.</p>

<h3 id="readings">Readings</h3>

<p>Readings are the meat of the content. As the name implies, each module has several readings on the topic of the module. There are also screencasts (basically, instructional videos) to help with your comprehension, as it may be easier for you to understand things after watching us, the instructors, do the things the readings cover. At the end of some of the readings,  you will complete the corresponding experiential learning activities.</p>

<h3 id="experiential-learning">Experiential Learning</h3>

<p>The experiential learnings are the exercises you must complete after certain readings in order to get a hands-on learning experience and fully understand the concepts. Coding is difficult to learn just by reading and watching videos. Actually doing the exercises and coding challenges is crucial to your education here at Jr DevLeague Academy.</p>

<h2 id="navigating-jdla-web-development">Navigating JDLA Web Development</h2>

<p><strong>Modules need to be completed in order.</strong> This means you must do them one after the other, in numerical order. Don’t skip around or you will get lost and die. Your peers will surpass you because they will have the fundamental knowledge that you don’t. So no matter what you think you know, <strong>do the modules in numbered order</strong>. Even if you join in with knowledge and experience with HTML/CSS and JavaScript, we guarantee there will be new things you will learn that you haven’t heard of before.</p>

<h3 id="what-to-do-when-youre-done-with-a-reading">What to do when you’re done with a reading</h3>

<p>After completing a reading, there will be links on the bottom of the page indicating which reading or exercise to go to next. You could go back in your browser and complete all of the readings first, but it’s recommended you follow the links to complete the experiential learning when it’s most relevant.</p>
